If the owner collects a deposit, you should be given a receipt with the paid amount written on it, so that you won’t have any problems with its refund later. If the rent agreement has been concluded for an indefinite time and the rent is paid monthly, then you can terminate the agreement with a three-month notice at the end of a calendar month."
