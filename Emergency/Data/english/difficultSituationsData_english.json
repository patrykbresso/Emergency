You can also call 828 828 828, the helpline for blocking cards of all banks. If you‘ve lost your ID card, driving license or passport, you should report it to the authority or institution which issued the document. If it came from your country, inform your consulate or embassy. Do it as soon as you can, so that no one can use your documents. If they‘ve been stolen, report it to the Police, which marks them in their databases as lost. You can do it at the nearest Police station."

But what to do if the theft did happen?\n\nReport the case to the Police at the Police station competent for the area where the theft occurred. You will find the contact details of an appropriate Police station in the app. \n\nWhile heading to the station, prepare some information: date and time of the event and the place where it happened (these information can be saved automatically after selecting the Help Button in the app). Next you’ll have to produce the description of the stolen item, its distinctive characteristics, brand, model, and even better – a serial number. If you can, describe the perpetrator’s appearance and identify the direction from which he or she approached you or in which s/he escaped. Providing information on the exact place where the theft happened is crucial, as it will allow to determine whether the area is under surveillance."

        "text": "If you have been a witness or a victim of racist or xenophobic behaviour or the incitement of hatred, you should report it, also if the whole thing happened on the Internet. \n\nThe notification of a crime can be reported in writing in the public prosecutor‘s office, with the detailed description of the entire event. You can also do it in person at a Police station. Initiating a criminal case doesn’t prevent you from claiming your rights, including damages, in civil proceedings.\n\nIf you’ve been exposed to hate speech on the Internet, please remember that the enforcement authorities have numerous methods of establishing the identity of anonymous individuals hiding behind their computer screens. It is crucial to nip such behaviours in the bud and report them before the situation gets dangerous. Serious crimes may result in detaining the perpetrator in order to stop him or her from carrying out the threats or continuing violent behaviour."
